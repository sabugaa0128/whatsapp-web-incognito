# WhatsApp Web Incognito + Delete Indicator

Deleted messages turns red, simple. Nothing too special. \
Why? Cuz I am tired of people asking how I am replying to messages I didn't know was deleted.


Feature were added on top of the [original extension](github.com/tomer8007/whatsapp-web-incognito). Thanks to [@tomer8007](github.com/tomer800) for the awesome extension.
